  4.  "The Food Plans represent a nutritious diet at four different cost
      levels. The nutritional bases of the Food Plans are the 1997-2005
      Dietary Reference Intakes, 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and
      2005 MyPyramid food intake recommendations. In addition to cost,
      differences among plans are in specific foods and quantities of foods.
      Another basis of the Food Plans is that all meals and snacks are
      prepared at home. For specific foods and quantities of foods in the
      Food Plans, see Thrifty Food Plan, 2006 (2007) and The Low-Cost,
      Moderate-Cost, and Liberal Food Plans, 2007 (2007). All four Food
      Plans are based on 2001-02 data and updated to current dollars by
      using the Consumer Price Index for specific food items." (USDA-FNS

  6.  Yearly values are constructed by monthly values (rounded to the
      nearest tenth in the USDA reports) multiplied by 12 and averaged over
      all available months.
  7.  Missing month-year observations are imputed based on a linear
      interpolation between nonmissing data.
  8.  For years 1994-2020, the missing month-year observations include
      5/1999, 7/1999, 4/2002, and 11/2020 onward.
  9.  For years 1965-1993, data collection is still in process, and most
      years are represented for one summer month until updated to quarterly
      data.
 10.  Estimates for Alaska and Hawaii are reported separately by USDA for
      Thrifty Food Plan costs only, and for only a subset of the
      demographics (children aged 6-8, 9-11, and adults 20-50 by gender).
      Imputed values are constructed first for missing demographics, which
      are assumed to be proportional to national costs at a ratio equal to
      the nearest age range observed in both national and non-contiguous
      state by year.  Similarly, other food plan costs are assumed to be
      proportional to the observed Thrifty Food Plan according to the same
      national ratio by year.
